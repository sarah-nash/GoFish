# GoFish

Object-Oriented approach to Go Fish. This Go Fish supports 2 types of play: pairs (2 cards must match in number) and books (4 cards must match in number). Additionally, the game can be modified to use fewer suits or fewer ranks. 

The main objects used are: 
- Cards : each card has a suit and a rank. 
- Decks : each deck has a mutable number of suits and ranks. Additionally, the Decks class has multiple functions to simulate a real deck. 
- Players: each player has a distinct hand, can keep track of pairs/books, be human or virtual (automatic), and more. 


Project created Spring 2021 Object Oriented Programming with Dr. Caitrin Eaton.

Note: LifeProcedural.java not used in the GoFish project.
